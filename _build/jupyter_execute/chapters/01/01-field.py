# Field

## Definition
**Field**

A field is a set F together with two binary operations on F called addition + and multiplication and $\exists 0\in F\ \ \exists 1\in F\ \ \ 0\ne 1$ such that:
1. $\left( F,+ \right)$ is an abelian group with 0 as the identity.
2. $\left( F-\left\{ 0 \right\},* \right)$ is an abelian group with 1 as the identity.
3. Distributivity:

$$\forall a,\ b,c\ \in F\ \ a*\left( b+c \right)=a*b+a*c$$

## Examples:
1. The real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, with the usual addition and multiplication form a field. 
2. The Rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$, with the usual addition and multiplication form a field.
3. The complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ with the usual addition and multiplication form a field. 

Recall that for ${{z}_{1}}={{a}_{1}}+{{b}_{1}}i,\ {{z}_{2}}={{a}_{2}}+{{b}_{2}}i\ \in \ \mathbb{C}\ $ define multiplication as:

$${{z}_{1}}{{z}_{2}}=\left( {{a}_{1}}{{a}_{2}}-{{b}_{1}}{{b}_{2}} \right)+\left( {{a}_{1}}{{b}_{2}}+{{a}_{2}}{{b}_{1}} \right)i\ \in \ \mathbb{C}\ $$
